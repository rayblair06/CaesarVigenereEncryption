## Synopsis

A Caesar &amp; Vigenere Encryption and Decryption application I wrote for the online Harvard Course CS50. https://cs50.harvard.edu

## Installation

These files are mostly for code demonstration but I have supplied two files which can be ran under Linux. If you were to try and compile these you would require the CS50 library.
